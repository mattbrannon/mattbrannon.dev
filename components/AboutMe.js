      <p>
        I've always had an interest in tech. When I was a little kid, my dad taught me how
        to work my way around an MS-DOS system. When I got a little older and had my first
        Mac, I started learning all about Unix systems and how to work from the command
        line.

        Since that time, I've had the opportunity to work with and learn from some
        wonderful people. A couple years ago, I was fortunate enough to join Hack
        Reactor's 38th cohort in Austin, Tx. After graduating, I stayed on as a resident
        for an additional two cohorts. After my residency with Hack Reactor, I flew
        halfway around the world to a little country on the Northern tip of Africa called
        Tunisia to work as a full-time instructor in the country's first and only coding
        bootcamp.
