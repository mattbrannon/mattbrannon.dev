# Server setup

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Id fugit nihil est reiciendis facilis minus dolores rerum,
deserunt veritatis ipsa excepturi neque dolore! Alias, recusandae ipsa harum quae laborum delectus?

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for anyone looking to get their feet wet setting up a remote server. Command line familiarity is
a plus but not required.

### Disclaimer

I am not a security expert. These are the steps I take when setting up my own servers. If you find a flaw in my
approach, I'd be happy to know about it.

## Getting started

blah blah

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A remote server instance. I would suggest either [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) or
  [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Familiarity with the command line is a plus but not required.

## SSH

Try this: `ssh` into your server and run this command `sudo lastb`;

sudo rsync --archive --chown=gizmo:gizmo ~/.ssh /home/gizmo

sudo sed -i 's/Port 2648/Port 9173/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

sudo usermod -aG sudo gizmo
