## Who am I?

I'm Matt. Hopefully you knew that by this point considering where you are… So yeah, I've written the
copy for this page several times now. Every time I write it, I come back to it later and cringe. So
I don't know… I'm not good at selling myself. I like to think I know what I'm doing when it comes to
software development. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. But I think that's true of everyone. But
I'm pretty sure I don't completely suck. So I got that going for me, which is nice.

In all seriousness though, I really enjoy programming. I feel very fortunate to have found my way
into this field. As a teenager and then a young man, my original goal was to pursue a career in
music. And then sometime in my mid 30's I just started feeling like, music was not the right path
for me. I mean, I love playing music, I play every day. But a career in music is about more than
just playing music. Suffice to say, I love music but not the industry.

I think that's enough for now. I feel like this is a bit less cringe worthy than previous attempts.
Let's hope.
