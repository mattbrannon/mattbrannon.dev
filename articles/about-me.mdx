  "Are you curious to know more about who I am? Are you maybe a little nosy? It's ok I'm nosy too.
  My name is Matt Brannon and if you're not satisfied with that limited amount of information then,
  this post is for you."

## Who am I?

I'm Matt. Hopefully you knew that by this point considering where you areâ€¦ So yeah, I've written the
copy for this page several times now. Every time I write it, I come back to it later and cringe. So
I don't knowâ€¦ I'm not good at selling myself. I like to think I know what I'm doing when it comes to
software development. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. But I think that's true of everyone. But
I'm pretty sure I don't completely suck. So I got that going for me, which is nice.

In all seriousness though, I really enjoy programming. I feel very fortunate to have found my way
into this field. As a teenager and then a young man, my original goal was to pursue a career in
music. And then sometime in my mid 30's I just started feeling like, music was not the right path
for me. I mean, I love playing music, I play every day. But a career in music is about more than
just playing music. Suffice to say, I love music but not the industry.

I think that's enough for now. I feel like this is a bit less cringe worthy than previous attempts.
Let's hope.

<!-- As I mentioned on the home page, I'm a musician and software developer. I started playing music when
I was 13. Learning to play music was probably one of the best decisions I ever made. I used to be in
a band called [Sidekick Mafia](https://open.spotify.com/album/3hVovKCgIAKvnvBSnyJ1YA). We put out
one album and played a ton of shows in Texas and the surrounding states. One time we drove all the
way to Missouri for a gig that paid 50 bucks.

It wasn't about the money, though. It was just about getting out there, playing shows, and making
our mark on the world. Sadly, fame and fortune weren't in the cards for us, and I knew I needed to
find another way to make a living. As it turns out, what I actually found was a new passion. -->

<!-- ## From band camp to boot camp

I started teaching myself how to code in my spare time. I learned how to use the Terminal command
line and spent the first couple of years of my programming journey focused almost exclusively on
[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) and shell scripting. After a while, I tried my hand at
[Python](https://www.python.org/). Though I'm fond of the language these days, the syntax and
indentation rules initially threw me for a loop. I found it incredibly frustrating to write several
lines of code or more, only to have it not run because I didn't indent one line correctly.

It was a couple of years before I even thought about Javascript. It always seemed so much more
complex than anything I'd done before. Partially because, at that time, most of what I'd seen was
[minified](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)>) source code. As silly as it
may sound, I honestly wondered, _who_ are these javascript programmers, and _why_ did they ever
choose to learn such an unreadable language? ðŸ˜…

Once I realized I didn't have to be a robot to read and write Javascript code, it quickly became my
primary focus above all others. Having already a bit of experience with other languages, I picked it
up fairly quickly. The syntax made sense to me, and it didn't yell at me for having a line indented
incorrectly. If Bash and Python had been love interests, you could say Javascript turned out to be
the one I married. Although I still use Bash and Python, so _maybe not the best analogy._

## These are the droids you're looking for

After some time, I started to feel like I knew what I was doing. Then I applied to
[Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com) and soon realized that was not the case. For some
reason, they accepted me, though, and somehow I actually graduated. I stayed on as a resident for
three months after graduating. Once my studies and subsequent employment with Hack Reactor had
finished, I returned home for the first time in 6 months. A short time after arriving home, I
accepted a position at a company called [RBK](https://www.rebootkamp.net). Within a few weeks of
accepting the position, I boarded a plane and flew halfway around the world to a little country
called Tunisia.

RBK is a coding Bootcamp whose goal is to bring the opportunities we enjoy in America to people in
the middle east. Their primary campus is in Jordan, with another campus in Tunisia. I was lucky
enough to be on the instruction team of cohort #1 in Tunisia. Half of our students were local
Tunisian residents, while the other half were primarily from Lybia. I met some of the best people
I've ever known during my time overseas. It was an honor and a privilege to be part of the team and
play a role in the country's first coding Bootcamp. If you've never visited an Arab country, I'd
highly recommend it.

### Some interesting facts about Tunisia:

- Their primary language is Arabic, but almost every Tunisian also speaks fluent French. In many
  cases, the Tunisian accent sounds more French than Arabic.
- Tunisia has a democratic form of government which is relatively new. The former president of
  Tunisia had been in power for 23 years before fleeing to Saudi Arabia in 2011 due to the
  [Tunisian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution), which subsequently was
  the catalyst for the well-known [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring).
- Whether you've visited the country or not, you've probably seen some of the landscape on more than
  one occasion. George Lucas used it during the filming of Star Wars as the setting for Luke
  Skywalkers' home planet, _Tatooine_.
- The name _Tatooine_ wasn't creative thinking on the part of George Lucas. The name comes from the
  city of [Tataouine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tataouine), a place used by the film crew as a
  hub during the movie's filming.
- Also, many of the scenes from Raiders of the Lost Ark, another George Lucas movie, were filmed in
  Tunisia.
- The ancient ruins of [Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage) are located just outside
  the capital city of Tunis along the mediterranean sea.

  die for. ðŸ¥°

### So long and thanks for all the fish

Visiting another country is something I think everyone should experience. If you have the means to
do so, you owe it to yourself to travel somewhere you've never been. I was fortunate enough to visit
Italy and Amsterdam during my time abroad. And I'm so glad I took the opportunity to do that when I
did. I returned home from my travels at the beginning of March 2020. About a week later, the world
went into lockdown.

During the pandemic, I had a lot of free time on my hands and, as such, decided it was time to get
comfortable with and understand CSS. Before this point, I felt generally uncomfortable and at odds
with CSS. Going back to the terrible analogy from earlier, If Javascript were the person I married,
CSS would be the in-laws. It's not that you don't like them, but you're also happy when they go home
after a visit. Luckily, I stumbled across a
[fantastic course](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js) by
[Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) and dove in headfirst. I started rebuilding my site from
the ground up. I think it turned out pretty good if I do so say myself.

So yeah... that's that. If you read this far then I'm grateful to you for taking an interest. If
you'd like to _<InternalLink href="/contact">get in touch</InternalLink>_ with me, I'd love to hear
from you. Thanks for reading! -->
