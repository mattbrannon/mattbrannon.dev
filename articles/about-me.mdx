## Who am I?

I'm Matt. Hopefully you knew that by this point considering where you are… So yeah, I've written this page several times
now. Every time I write it, I come back to it later and cringe. So I don't know… I'm not good at selling myself. I like
to think I know what I'm doing when it comes to software development.
[Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq6inpgBChM) But I think that's true of everyone.
But I'm pretty sure I don't completely suck. So I got that going for me, which is nice.

In all seriousness though, I really enjoy programming. I feel very fortunate to have found my way into this field. As a
teenager and then a young man, my original goal was to pursue a career in music. And then at some point I just started
feeling like, music was not the right path for me. I mean, I love playing music, I play every day. But a career in music
is about more than just playing music. Suffice to say, I love music but not the industry.

I think that's enough for now. I feel like this is a bit less cringe worthy than previous attempts. Let's hope.
