        <Heading>Motivation</Heading>
        <text.paragraph>
          Ever since I caught the programming bug, I've always wanted to build a chat room application. I always kinda
          felt like if I could do that and come away with something that actually worked, I could finally think of
          myself as real programmer. When you're first starting out, the idea of building a chat app feels so beyond you
          that it seems like only super talented rockstar programmers could that kind of thing. Now, I am by no means a
          super talented rockstar programmer. But I am a programmer and, I built a chat app to prove it. ðŸ˜Š

        <Heading>FrontEnd</Heading>
        <text.paragraph>
          The choice to use React for building out the frontend was, by far, the easiest decision of the project. Using
          a component based approach allowed me write small chunks of code that could be reused multiple times. I was
          able to build some pretty cool components in this app. I'm especially proud of the floating label text input.
          Also, you can't really tell from the app but, the social media signin buttons are completely scalable. The
          button logo and any text scales evenly with the viewport. Every bit of css is hand written. The bulk of the
          app uses CSS Modules for styling. SASS is also used here and there and there's even a few styled-components
          lying around.

        <text.paragraph>
          I have to give credit where credit is due. Firebase was such a lifesaver on this app. Utilizing Firebase for
          data storage allowed me not only to have a robust and battle tested real time database, it also allowed me to
          implement multiple authentication methods for user sign up and login functionality. Users are able to login
          with their Google or Facebook accounts as well as the standard email / password combination. The user signup
          form performs input validation of each field as the user types. Coupled with a debounce function ensures a
          more pleasant user experience while at also providing instant feedback to the user.
